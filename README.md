Final Project Proposal: What Parameters Affect Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa?
Eduardo Panneflek, Christina Rawls, Christine Robertson

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

Objective:
Using linear regression, we hope to better understand what parameters affect housing prices. We will aim to create and compare at least 2 models and use results to better understand how the parameters may affect price in this specified region. These models will then be trained and tested.

Process:

1) Model
	- Parameters
	Lot area: lot size in square footage

2) Model 
	- Parameters
	Lot area:
	Month Sold: (Will growth increase over time? Is a particular season more profitable? )

3) Model
	- Parameters
	Lot area:
	MSZoning: Identify the general zoning class of the sale

	Other Parameters:
	Amenities (fireplace, pool, porch)
	BldgType: Type of dwelling 
	Utilities available (electricity, gas, water)
	HouseStyle: Style of dwelling
	SaleType: Type of sale
	Neighborhood
	Heating: Type of Heating
	Lot configuration

Next steps, looking ahead/ stretch goal:
If our team was able to continue this project and we had access to more data, we might try applying these models and testing to different geographical locations to compare and contrast with our original region.
